        <h3>Packaged Meat</h3>
        <p>
	<b>In our modern world many issues arise along with many solutions, and it is our responsibility to find those solutions and apply them to help make the world a better place for all of us. That is exactly what Brendan Buhler is trying to get us to explore as we read his “On Eating Roadkill, the Most Ethical Meat” essay. Roadkill is when cars hit animals as they are crossing the street, the carcass is the “roadkill”. Buhler’s uses ethos, logos, and pathos to try to get the reader to understand his point of view as using the roadkill for meat, a point of view that could have a positive impact on our lives and spread awareness among today’s shoppers in the U.S.<br><br>
	Buhler uses logos to get the readers to understand how effective it is to use roadkill as a food source as Buhler pointed out, “State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company estimated that some 1,232,000 deer were hit by cars in the United States” (1). Although, roadkill meat is just a fraction of what the U.S. needs to satisfy its food demands, this roadkill meat plays a huge part in increasing people’s awareness of roadkill and their willingness to eat it. Buhler considers using as much as we can of the potential “20 million pounds” (1) of roadkill and depend less on the resource contingent “23 billion pounds of beef” that is produced in the U.S. and is bought from marts.<br><br>
	Buhler reaches out to the readers emotions using pathos. In which he tries to demonstrate how strong our feelings about roadkill are and how mixed they can be. Some people feel uncomfortable about the subject of roadkill, would they reject not only roadkill, but rather all kinds of meat if they have insides on how it is produced? As Buhler wrote “Texas, California and Washington may not agree on much, but they are three of the very few states that agree that possession of roadkill is illegal.” (1). It is clearly stated by the Buhler that roadkill is a highly controversial topic. It is also evident that Buhler furthers his argument on the controversiality of roadkill using pathos, as he expresses a highly respected and emotional term, such as illegality in some states, when discussing the topic of roadkill. Carrie Wilson, a marine biologist, considers Buhler’s question, in which he asks, “would people run down a deer for meat?”, she responds: “There are people who do it, unfortunately,” (1). Buhler uses this as proof of the sheer amount of mixed opinion with regards to this issue. Furthermore, he reaches out to the reader’s emotions by exposing a darker side of the matter, clearly using pathos in the process.<br><br>
		Throughout the reading Buhler appears as a very credible writer, by using ethos he establishes a trustworthy relationship with his audience. Buhler appeals to the reader’s sense of logic in many ways, as Buhler said, “If the roadkill is fresh, perhaps hit on a cold day and ideally a large animal, it is as safe as any game.” (1). Think about the keywords “fresh”, “cold”, and “safe”, words that won him the reader’s trust. Even more, Buhler uses credible facts form companies like State Farm along with his own opinion, backing him up from any doubt that the reader might have about the writing. Buhler also introduces the reader to a roadkill cooking event and encourages the reader to join, as he said, “Head to the annual Roadkill Cook-off and Festival in West Virginia.” (1). Doing this forces the reader to take side with Buhler and his view, as he doesn’t only want the reader to accept his point of view but to also be interested in this particular subject.<br><br>
		In conclusion, Buhler succeeds to fascinate his readers with his points of view on the issue of roadkill and how much of an important rule ethos, logos, and pathos played on Buhler wining his audience. Indeed, roadkill is an interesting subject to discus- for the simple fact that people have different opinions in this controversial issue. After all the most important thing is not to get the reader to agree or disagree with Buhler but to throw the issue of roadkill out there and acknowledge its existence in today’s world.<br>
